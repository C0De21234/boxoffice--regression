# 🎬 Box Office Revenue Prediction

This project demonstrates Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using synthetic movie data (Budget, Box Office, and Ratings).
It’s a beginner-friendly data science project that compares two models and visualizes their performance.

# 📊 Project Overview

Goal: Predict movie box office revenue from budget and ratings.
Techniques Used:
Simple Linear Regression (Budget → Box Office)
Multiple Linear Regression (Budget + Rating → Box Office)
Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

# 📂 Files in This Repository

regression_analysis.py → Main Python script with code for regression models & plots
requirements.txt → Dependencies to run the project
plots.png → Visualization output (generated after running the script)
README.md → Project documentation

# ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/C0De21234/boxoffice-regression.git
cd boxoffice-regression
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script
python regression_analysis.py
# this will:
✔️ Train both models
✔️ Show evaluation metrics
✔️ Generate a visualization (plots.png)

# 📈 Sample Output
